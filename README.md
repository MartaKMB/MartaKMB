# Hi, I'm Marta 👋 🪰

I'm a front-end developer who is passionate about creating technology to help people and make them smile. 😁

### 🤓 Self-taught front-end developer

In 2017, I decided to learn how to code and enjoy the process until today. ✨ It's never ending story, and I like to learn new things.

I enjoy working with React ⚛️  and love CSS drawing 🎨 - making nice and funny images on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/martakmb).

### 👩‍💻 Work experience

I get my first job in tech industry in 2018 at [RSQ Technologies](https://www.rsqtechnologies.com/), where I was involved in developing web (React) applications for healthcare providers. Currently I co-create largest website for readers and book recommendations in Poland [LubimyCzytac](https://lubimyczytac.pl/).

Outside of programming I'm instructor and book author (I learn owners how to make relaxing pet 🐶 massage). 
For this project I'm also front-end developer: I build [websites](https://martamucha.pl/) and I'm working at React application for dog owners.
